# 📊 Adult Census Income Preprocessing

## 📌 Overview
This project preprocesses the **UCI Adult Census Income dataset** (also known as the “Census Income” dataset) to clean, transform, and prepare the data for machine learning models.  

It represents my **third preprocessing project**, after Titanic and UCI Heart Disease, and shows my growing ability to handle **larger, more complex datasets** with advanced preprocessing techniques like **pipelines** and **categorical encoders**.

## 🎯 Goal of this project
Compared to my previous projects, this one helped me to:
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with Seaborn & Matplotlib  
- Deal with **missing values and duplicate records** in a real-world dataset  
- Apply **different encoding techniques** (One-Hot + Frequency Encoding) for categorical variables  
- Use **ColumnTransformer & Pipelines** to streamline preprocessing  
- Strengthen my ability to scale preprocessing for large tabular datasets

## ⭐ Features
- Loading and exploring the Adult Census dataset  
- Detecting and handling missing values & duplicates  
- EDA with correlation heatmaps and feature distributions  
- Encoding categorical variables using:
  * **One-Hot Encoding** (for nominal features)  
  * **Frequency/Count Encoding** (for high-cardinality categorical features)  
- Using `ColumnTransformer` and `Pipeline` for modular preprocessing  
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arsalanManavii/adult_census_income_preprocessing.git
   cd adult_census_income_preprocessing

2. **Install dependencies**

## 🚀 My Progression (Titanic → Heart Disease → Adult Census)
- ✅ Titanic Project: Learned the basics,missing values, encoding categorical data, simple scaling.
- 🚑 Heart Disease Project: Applied these skills to medical data, with mixed feature types and more domain-driven preprocessing.
- 🏢 Adult Census Project: Took the next step — EDA, pipelines, multiple encoding methods, duplicate handling — preparing a large, real-world socio-economic dataset.

## 💯 Next Steps to Practice As A Data Scientist
- **Web Scraping**  
  Collect my own dataset from the web and build a meaningful ML model.  
- **SQL for Data Analysis**  
  Practice SQL queries for advanced data cleaning and exploration.  
- **End-to-End Project**  
  Combine **web scraping + SQL + Python** into a complete ML pipeline, from raw data collection to model deployment.
